# HELIOS Project

## Introduction:

Much attention has been paid to estimating the impact of scientific investment.  However, the effort has been largely manual and hence expensive, burdensome, and error-prone.  In addition, the focus has been largely mechanical in nature—drawing a direct line between funding and outputs—rather than focusing on the scientists that do the work.
Although the results should be treated as illustrative, the approach we test here can be used to examine the impact of research funding on scientific output in terms of publications, citations, collaborations and international activity, controlling for both observed and unobserved factors.  We argue that full engagement of scientific funders with the scientific community to expand data capacity and evaluation tools would be a fruitful approach to enable a more scientific assessment of scientific investments.
