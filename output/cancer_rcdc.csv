The amount of cytotoxic agents with documented activity against MOEC-SC is limited but responses have been documented with cisplatin, fluorouracil, vindesine, mitomycin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinorelbine, as well as with various combinations of the aforementioned compounds. However, there is no available randomized trial supporting any kind of survival benefit with chemotherapy for patients with MOEC-SC. As most of the physicians are intimately convinced of a favourable impact of chemotherapy on outcome, no randomized trial comparing chemotherapy to BSC can be run and, in routine practice, most of the patients in good condition are treated with fluoropyrimidin- and/or platinum salts-based regimen. This attitude leads to the delivery of cytotoxics with unproven benefit but some side effects and unjustified costs.
To overcome this situation, we are launching a multicenter randomized phase II study to evaluate the benefit of chemotherapy plus BSC versus BSC in patients with MOEC-SC who have not experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity during a 2 month-course of chemo-therapy of any kind.",Ministère des Affaires sociales et de la Santé,DGOS_2555,Centre Oscar Lambret,grid.452351.4,1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,Cancer;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities,248109.0,2010-06-01,2013-06-01,Ministère des Affaires sociales et de la Santé,True,False,Centre Oscar Lambret,True,Antoine ADENIS,"ADENIS, Antoine",1,3,False

This is a path that should lead the fight against tumor progression. Among adults, this process is triggered by specific situations (end of cycle menstrual tissue healing post-lesion), and is inactivated under physiological conditions due to a balance between pro-angiogenic factors and anti-angiogenic. During tumor growth this balance is broken """"), because most tumor cells, but also the peritumoral stroma, release of pro-angiogenic factors in excess in the extracellular space (angiogenic switch). neoangiogenesis This process is essential for tumor development, it can also spread. Neutralize this process of neovascularization in the case of cancer, is a promising approach for the development of new anti-cancer treatments that we hope less toxic than those used today.
Problem: Interest therapeutic inhibitors of aminopeptidase-N-N_AP [EC 3.4.11 .2]-CD13
Aminopeptidases (Aps) exopeptidases are ubiquitous in mammals. They catalyze the hydrolysis reaction of the amino acid amino-terminal position of a peptide or protein. This is a very specific aminopeptidase that we are interested, the AP-N or CB13. These studies have been replicated by other groups with other types of inhibitors of this aminopepticlase. A recent review focuses on the role of aminopeptidases in oncology as well as the importance of developing other inhibitory molecules stronger and more selective than bestatin, actinonin or amastatin.
• All of these results were validated by very recent work (Rangel et al. PNAS 2007. 104, 4588 ¬ 4593). It is now demonstrated that neovascularization is deeply inhibited in mice ""knock-out"" no longer expressing AP-N or CB13. These results establish definitively the importance of AP-N in the process of angiogenesis.

• It has been recently shown that the expression of this ectoenzyme on the surface of cells is related to the phenomena of cell motility, it is now considered an important regulator of endothelial morphogenesis during the process of angiogenesis. Inhibitors, which block the catalytic activity of this enzyme (bestatin which an inhibition constant (Ki) of 3.5 microM on PA-N), interfere with this process. They are active in the classical models of angiogenesis.
> Vascularization of the retina caused by hypo-oxygenation
Vasculature (in the presence of a growth factor, bFGF) of a fabric graft over the membrane chorioallantolque chicken embryo
> The bestatin, actinonin and antibodies against AP-N and its catalytic activity have a significant effect on the growth of tumors implanted in mice type ""nude"" Treated animals showed no tumor progression established.
This new function of AP-N is still little known in its mode of action. It is clear that the catalytic activity of the enzyme itself is involved in these processes, either directly or through chemokines and growth factors whose activity is modulated by AP-N.
• It appears that inhibition of AP-N interferes not with cell growth, but the process of endothelial morphogenesis. Bestatin and its analogues as amastatin not affect the growth of endothelial cells, but affect their organization during neovascularization.
The AP-N inhibitors appear to inhibit endothelial morphogenesis.
The synthesis of new compounds (CBO & LASYRO) will be entrusted our PhD. We want to change the ""southern part"" of the molecule by focusing on the substituents R3. The development of synthetic methods has been widely introduced to the team LASYRO.
The student will also be responsible for determining the inhibition constants in vitro AP-N compounds, it has synthesized. It seems reasonable to imagine that after a period of six months in organic synthesis, two months would be devoted to enzymology, during the period of this thesis, This will of course depend potential difficulties encountered during synthesis work.

inca_11,Matthew,ALBERT,Inserm U818 - Institut Pasteur,grant.7154673,Evaluating the role of classical and non-classical T lymphocytes in a model of spontaneous bladder cancer and identifying strategies to optimize intravesical BCG therapy,"SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT  The study of patients with bladder cancer undergoing intravesical immuntherapy with Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) offers the unique opportunity to define mechanisms by which the immune system may be used to target tumour cells. Intravesical BCG therapy for the treatment of high grade non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma (NMIBC) and carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder is one of the most effective immunotherapies, with response rates ranging from 50-70% 4. Defining the mechanism of action for this treatment modality offers the possibility of defining true correlates of tumour immunity. The principles uncovered by such study may provide insight into the development of alternative treatment modalities for patients who fail therapy as well as those that present with muscle invasive disease. As bladder cancer remains one of the most costly malignancy to manage in the USA and Europe 5, and as muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a deadly disease, improvements in patient management would be beneficial not only for the individual but also for society at large.     DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT  The aim of this project are to:  I. Optimize pre-clinical models of bladder cancer for the analysis of BCG-mediated tumour immunity.   Ongoing human subject studies have provided new insight into the inflammatory response triggered by BCG when it is instilled into the bladders of cancer patients. To complement our translational research on human patients (currently supported by La Ligue and L’ARC), we are in need of small animal models that will help further our understanding of the mechanism(s) of tumour immunity and facilitate the development of pre-clinical data that may be used as the basis for future Phase I trials. Optimizing, validating and exploiting such models are the basis of this collaborative and interdisciplinary research program. Notably, in this revised application, we have included a new partner with great expertise in urothelial cancer genetics and the assessment of mouse tumour models for their relevance to human disease.  II. Define the key aspects of lymphocyte activation (both classical and non-classical populations) that are critical for immune infiltration and tumour immunity.  T cells have been suggested to be critical for BCG-mediated control of bladder cancer. In addition to classical lymphocytes, one of the unique aspects of the project will be the study of MAIT cells and other innate T cells known to react to mycobacterial-infected cells 6, thus suggesting their potential importance in BCG-mediated tumour immunity.   III. Evaluate natural and genetically modified BCG strains for their ability to enhance tumour immunity.   We have been evaluating several natural and recombinant strains of BCG as a strategy to optimize / improve upon the exisiting standard of care. In particular, we have recently shown superiority for the Connaught strain, as compared to Tice strain in protection against disease progression. There are currently 7 BCG strains in clinical use- we propose to assess their comparative ability to initiate anti-tumour immunity in pre-clinical models developed within the context of this project. We are also excited about BCG expressing the listeriolysin protein (referred to as BCG::hly). As part of a research collaboration with Vaccine Project Management (VPM) GmbH and Stefan Kaufmann (Max Plank Institute), we have been evaluating the interaction of BCG::hly and urothelial cells in vitro. The results are promising and we now aim to perform pre-clinical testing thus allowing us to generate proof-of-concept that BCG::hly improves response to treatment by improving immune activation. Cross-priming of classical anti-tumour CD8+ T cells as well as the stimulation of non-classical lymphocytes will be evaluated.    EXPECTED RESULTS  The question of how the immune system can be used to achieve tumour immunity receives much attention. This may be noted by the number of high-profile papers published in this field. This attention is due to the complexity and great need for novel therapeutic modalities. In particular, we point out the need for validated correlates of tumour immunity. Bladder cancer provides an unique opportunity – one that surprisingly few people have capitalized upon.  Our global efforts (human and pre-clinical mouse models combined with expertise in utilizing recombinant BCG) put us is a strong position for success and within the context of this project, we expect to deliver:  (i) robust pre-clinical models for the study of bladder cancer-  (ii) correlates of tumour immunity and information about classical and non-classical T cells in BCG therapy- and   (iii) clear evidence for BCG strain as a determinant of response to therapy, with the identification of novel strategies for initiating Phase I/II clinial trials in humans.",French National Cancer Institute,INCa_5975,Pasteur Institute,grid.428999.7,1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis;1107 Immunology,Vaccine Related;Cancer;Urologic Diseases,564589.0,2012-12-27,2015-12-27,French National Cancer Institute,True,True,Pasteur Institute,True,Matthew ALBERT,"ALBERT, Matthew",2,3,False
inca_12,Laurence,ALBIGES-SAUVIN,Institut Gustave Roussy,grant.7154522,Preclinical validation of FGFR1 as potential therapetic target in breast cancer,"The identification and validation of new therapeutic targets in breast carcinoma is a major challenge in oncology. Among the molecular anomalies, those related to tyrosine kinase are especially attractive since inhibitors are already available to target such anomalies. We have recently shown that FGFR1 present high level of amplification in around 11% of breast carcinoma (n=106). In the same study, FGFR1 gene amplifications correlated with gene expression. FGFR1 is a tyrosine kinase that has been shown to be involved in prostatic carcinogenesis in animal models. Overall, these data suggest that FGFR1 could be dysregulated in around 10% of breast cancer samples, and could represent a potential therapeutic target. We want to validate FGFR1 as therapeutic target in breast carcinoma.   Spécific Aims : Methods  A. To evaluate the frequency of FGFR1 aonmalies in a large series of breast cancer  In order to assess the frequency of FGFR1 gene amplification, we will perform a CISH FGFR1 on a tissue microarray that includes 823 breast carcinoma. This tissue array has been previously successfully used for TOP2A FISH. In the same time, we will perform tumor immunostaining for phosphorylated FGFR1 in order to detect the frequency of FGFR1 activation in this patient population.  This part of the project will be performed in the laboratory of pathology from Translational Research Unit of IGR.    B.  To assess the effect of FGFR1-specific siRNA on tumor cell growth  We have identified three cell lines that present FGFR1 gene amplification. We will assess the effect of siRNA on these three cell lines and on FGFR1 non amplified lines. The siRNA effect on cell proflieration will be assessed by MTT assay at day 4 and 6 post-transfection. In addition, we will assess the effect of siRNA on AKT phosphorylation.   C.  To assess the antitumor effect of a specific FGFR1 inhibitor.  Two FGFR1 are available for laboratory use in our unit. We will first assess whether the three FGFR1-amplified cell line scan be successfully engraft and grow in nude mice. We will then assess the antitumor effect of FGFR1-inhibitors in FGFR1+ and FGFR1- tumors, in nude mice.  The effect of anti-FGFR1 on phosphoproteins and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition will also be evaluated.  Specific Aim A: This part should allow determining the incidence of FGFR1-dysregulations in breast cancer.   Specific aim B: This part will determine the implication of FGFR1 in cell proliferation according to the FGFR1 gene amplifications.  Specific aim C: This part will allow defining the anti-tumor efficacy of an FGFR1 targeting in vivo. As for the specific aim B, showing that the efficacy is limited to FGFR1 gene amplified tumors will help designing further clinical trials that will evaluate efficacy of FGFR1 inhibitors. This project should answer three questions.   a. What is the incidence of dysregulations in FGFR1 expression in breast cancer ? b. Is there a rationale to evaluate FGFR1 inhibitors in breast cancer ? c. Should clinical trials be limited to FGFR1-gene amplified tumors ?",French National Cancer Institute,INCa_0607,Institut Gustave Roussy,grid.14925.3b,1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,Biotechnology;Cancer;Breast Cancer,49032.0,2008-11-10,2009-11-09,French National Cancer Institute,True,True,Institut Gustave Roussy,True,Laurence ALBIGES-SAUVIN,"ALBIGES-SAUVIN, Laurence",1,3,False

During these last years, many new chemotherapies and targeted therapies have been developed improving significantly the overall survival of patients.     However, the choice of the therapeutic sequences becomes difficult due to the lack of validated predictive biomarkers of their efficiency. Indeed, only the mutation of the k-ras oncogene is a predictive factor of non-efficacy of the anti-EGFR antibodies. It is thus crucial to identify new biomarkers to propose the best personalized 1rst line therapeutic sequence.

On the one hand there is no qualitative study, today in France, about a concrete sequence, in length, of a clinical cancer research as it is experienced by patients. On the other hand, a study focused on the socio-historical evolution the patients’ status in clinical cancer research would complete the established knowledge on the history of cancer on one side and the history of biomedical research on the other.The double socio-historical and anthropological perspective would fill a gap in research on the specificity of the experience of patients participating in a clinical cancer research in France. Patients usually are in urgent and dramatic medical situations, so they have little opportunity to be heard by institutions although our study could contribute to improve the ethics of practices in biomedical experiment.   2- Description of the project  Our research project articulates three modes of knowledge.  First the ethnological one. We plan to produce an ethnographic study on the experience of cancer patients included in a clinical research. It will be focused on the issue of the specificity of this experience, seen through the concept of ""patient research partner"". It will be conducted by a doctoral student in anthropology from the EHESS in two oncology services participating in clinical trials, including one at the Gustave Roussy Institute in Villejuif. The methodology used for data collection will combine the inputs of participant-observation, interviews and ""history of life"" method. The collected elements will be analysed according to the methods of interpretative anthropology. The ground survey will be conducted over a period of 36 months and will lead to the writing of a doctoral thesis. Secondly the historical one: The study will involve the changing status of patients in clinical cancer trials in France. It will be led by a doctoral student drom History Research Center (HRC) for a year at half-time, in collaboration with a sociologist specialized in the study of normative frameworks of clinical research. It will enable us to review whether the patients’ status in biomedical cancer research has, or no,t any specific development compared with other diseases (tuberculosis, AIDS and so on.). But also to know history of the ""social construction"" on status of ""patient research partner"" that we want to investigate.  Interdisciplinary for the third, which will serve as an articulation between anthropological and historical components of the project. We plan to organize a seminar for interdisciplinary research, on the topic of patients in clinical research, in order to cross the perspective on our object. This monthly seminar will be conducted within the EHESS. It will have a twofold purpose: to mobilize researchers on the problem of patients in biomedical  cancer research, and to prepare the organisation of a one-day symposium on this subject. Ethnological study will offer knowledges on:   1) The concrete conditions of voluntary entrance in a clinical essay. 2) The motivations of the patients to take part in this essay. 3) The balance between the patient’s expectations and the reality of the research. 4) The quality of life of the patients included in a clinical experiment. 5) The nature of the ""work"" (Strauss, 1985) made by the patients during an essay.  - Historical research will enable us to know :  1) Changes in the status accorded to patients in a biomedical cancer experiment. 2) History of the concept of ""patient as partner"" in clinical research.   - The organization of a research seminar and an international conference will offer the possibility for:   1) The mobilization of social sciences resarchers on the issue of the experience of patients in clinical cancer research.  2) Establishing an area of exchanges around the human experience in clinical research, opening up opportunities for interdisciplinary and comparative reflections.",French National Cancer Institute,INCa_0855,Paris 13 University;Institut Gustave Roussy,grid.11318.3a;grid.14925.3b,1608 Sociology,Cancer,225631.0,2008-11-08,2011-11-08,French National Cancer Institute,True,True,Paris 13 University;Institut Gustave Roussy,True,Philippe AMIEL,"AMIEL, Philippe",1,1,False

Therapeutic advances have occurred with vemurafenib and ipilimumab. Primary or acquired resistances to these innovative treatments demonstrate that other targets are necessary. EMMPRIN/CD147, its role in tumor progression is admitted, is the topic of our research group and its role in tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Our work suggests that EMMPRIN/CD147, membrane glycoprotein enriched on tumor cells surface, is a crucial mediator of the tumor-stroma cooperation. We have shown that EMMPRIN induces the production of matrix proteases by various stromal cells, differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, regarded as central players in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis by regulating VEGF and VEGFR-2 via HIF-2alpha in endothelial cells. This regulation was found in melanoma tumor cells with implications for their malignant properties, suggesting that this regulation VEGFR-2/HIF-2 by EMMPRIN may be a more general mechanism.
This project proposes to identify the molecular domain responsible for regulating EMMPRIN system VEGFR-2/HIF¬2alpha and angiogenesis, to develop specific inhibitors of this regulation. The functional consequences of this area effect and the mechanisms involved in the signaling pathways by which the EMMPRIN domain regulates VEGFR-2 via the induction of HIF-2 will be analyzed.
Molecular modelization will help to identify residues responsible for this regulation and to identify anti-angiogenic pharmacological inhibitors targeting these residues. Evaluation and validation in vitro and in vivo, of the most effective inhibitors would open the way for an innovative therapeutic anti-angiogenic targeted strategy for tumors and melanomas.

inca_36,Bernard,ASSELAIN,Institut Curie,grant.7154656,Biological response to tamoxifen (TAM) in patients with breast cancer non metastatic RH+,"Tamoxifen (TAM) is an antiestrogen that acts by competitive inhibition of estradiol binding to its receptors. Its clinical effectiveness is amply demonstrated in all stages of hormone-dependent breast cancer. In recent years, aromatase inhibitors have shown a slight superiority in disease-free survival for early stage and metastatic cancers. The risk/benefit ratio of these two drug classes is unclear in subgroups of patients. The key enzyme in the metabolism of tamoxifen to endoxifen (the most active metabolite) is CYP2D6. There is great interindividual variability in CYP 2D6, linked to many genetic polymorphisms which influences their expression and functionality. Nearly 20% of Caucasian patients have a polymorphism of CYP2D6 resulting in a low transformation of tamoxifen endoxifen. Retrospective clinical work recently published have shown that these polymorphisms have an impact on progression-free survival of postmenopausal women treated with tamoxifen. The assumption is that poor metabolizers, resulting from low CYP2D6 activity, have lower levels of active metabolite in the plasma compared to heterozygous and wild type gene carriers. These observations suggest the need to track the status of the polymorphic CYP2D6 in order to better identify patients likely to benefit from TAM. Thus, according to FDA recommendations, this information was included in the SPC of TAM in October 2006. The work of the group of M Dowsett, performed in postmenopausal women, showed the necessity for a biological marker of early efficacy of treatment with TAM. Thus, after 2 and 12 weeks of treatment with tamoxifen, the mean change in the expression of KI-67 in tumor tissue is associated with clinical efficacy of treatment. Primary Objective: Our objective is to study the response to treatment with TAM in preoperative (operative patients at the outset) patients with non-metastatic, HR+ breast cancer, by measuring the change in expression of KI- 67 in the tumor after 6 weeks of treatment, the polymorphic status of cytochrome 2D6 and the pharmacokinetics of active TAM metabolites. Secondary Objectives:-To evaluate the frequency of polymorphisms of genes involved in metabolism of tamoxifen in the study population (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP1A1, CYP3A4, SULT1A1, UGT) - Assess changes in mitotic index as another potential marker for assessing the effectiveness of TAM - Assessing the molecular serum or early serum proteomics changes in their treatment as predictors of clinical response.

They are highly malignant, usually diagnosed at late stages and have very poor prognosis. Some risk factors (hepatitis, aflatoxin, alcohol, smoking) have been established, but the geographical variation of incidence rates suggests the etiological involvement of modifiable risk factors. But, little is known about HCC/CCA etiology in regions where the known risk factors are not predominant. Several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of dietary (particularly fruits, iron and coffee), lifestyle, obesity, metabolic and hormonal factors, yet no prospective studies have properly addressed their interactive roles in HCC/CCA risk. In this context, an in-depth analysis of these factors with measures of relevant biomarkers is proposed within the framework of the prospective EPIC study. Such a comprehensive approach will allow consideration of concomitant/synergistic risks for a clearer understanding of liver cancer etiology in European populations where little is known about the underlying risk factors and where HCC/CCA incidence is increasing.
Description of the Project: The main objective of this proposed study is to prospectively investigate the risk of HCC/CCA in association with key dietary, lifestyle, metabolic and hormonal factors with consideration of blood measures of several important biomarkers of these factors as well as HBV/HCV infection status. The second objective is to determine the potential interactions of these factors on the risk of HCC/CCA. The third objective is to utilize novel proteomic methodologies to assess protein changes in plasma to identify early pre-diagnostic biomarkers of HCC/CCA risk. To achieve these objectives a nested case-control study will be conducted based on the prospective EPIC study. EPIC has over 520,000 subjects enrolled and is a collaborative network of cohorts from 10 European countries (23 centres) including the large French E3N cohort (4 centres). Epidemiologic (diet/lifestyle) questionnaires and blood (stored under liquid nitrogen at -196°C) have been collected from subjects. A nested case-control study design with 1:2 incidence density matching of control subjects will be used for 216 HCC and 88 CCA cases with available blood samples. Dietary variables (food groups: fruits, vegetables, dairy, red/processed meats- specific foods: coffee- nutrients: iron, beta-carotene, vitamin C/E, fat, fat subtypes) will be determined from country-specific questionnaires. Serum/plasma samples will be utilized to measure relevant biomarkers pertaining to: body iron status (serum iron, transferrin, ferritin, UIBC, TIBC), obesity (fetuin, leptin), inflammation (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), hyperinsulinemia/insulin sensitivity (c-peptide, total/HMW adiponectin), IGF-I, testosterone and sex-hormone binding globulin. In addition, laboratory analyses will be conducted to determine hepatitis B/C infection status, a-feto-protein levels and enzymes of liver function. Anthropometric measures (height, weight, waist/hip ratio, waist/hip circumference etc) are interviewer measured (most centres) or self-reported (minority of centres). Statistical analyses will be conducted using multivariate conditional logistic regression models for all questionnaire and biomarker factors, adjusted as appropriate by confounding variables defined a priori. Interaction models will also be run for all factors.
Expected Results: The specific hypotheses of the proposed project are that (i) the risk of HCC is - decreased with higher intakes of fruits/vegetables (and their associated nutrients) and coffee; - decreased with higher physical activity- increased with higher alcohol intake, consumption of red/processed meats and iron; - increased by higher body iron status; - increased by obesity (BMI and other anthropometric measures); - increased by inflammation- increased by hyperinsulinemia/ insulin insensitivity; - increased by greater exposure to circulating androgens and IGF-I, and (ii) HBV/HCV infection modulates the association of these factors with risk of HCC. The above hypotheses also hold for CCA, but since little is known about this cancer, they are explorative. This project will add considerably to the scientific knowledge in this area by identifying the main dietary, lifestyle, metabolic and hormonal factors associated with the risk of HCC/CCA. The project is important because it will contrast risk factors in those with and without hepatitis infection. The identification of the cancer risks associated with dietary/lifestyle variables and exploration of the underlying mechanisms of these cancers is timely and of public health relevance.

inca_389,Hugues,de LAVALLADE,Imperial College London,grant.7154253,Combined application of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in chronic myeloid leukaemia,"Scientific Background: Considerable data from transplant studies indicate that chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) responds to immune therapy. Recently, because of their low toxicity and impressive efficacy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib are replacing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) as first-line therapy for CML. However the majority of patients have persisting molecular disease, and functional leukaemic CD34+ progenitor cells have been identified in such patients in complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR), suggesting the presence of a reservoir of leukaemic cells resistant to the TKI. Therefore novel strategies to eradicate quiescent CML stem cells should be pursued, and future developments in CML therapy seem likely to combine different approaches to integrate and reinforce the patient immune response against remaining leukaemic cells. The immunological graft-versus-leukaemia effect seen after allo-SCT suggests that the amplification of the patient’s own immune response to the disease might increase the depth of the responses seen after treatment with the TKI. One such approach would be to vaccinate the patient with leukaemia derived antigens.
Project description: Phase II study of a combination of TKI and vaccination using PR1 and WT1 peptides in CML- This study is sponsored by CRUK and due to commence in May 2010, (Principal Investigator: Dr Katy Rezvani). As imatinib alone is unlikely to be curative, and allo-SCT has risks and is only available to a minority of CML patients, we plan to develop an immunotherapy approach to boost the patient's own immune response against leukaemia in an attempt to induce long-lasting remissions. This study will capitalise on the state of minimal residual disease (MRD) achieved on imatinib and stimulate the immune response with a combination of PR1 and WT1 peptide vaccination to eliminate the remaining quiescent or resistant leukaemic stem cells. 1/ Study objective(s): Primary: - To determine the proportion of patients with a significant molecular response; Secondary endpoints: - To determine the proportion of patients who develop an immunological response. We will look for increases of circulating WT1 and PR1 specific T cells; - To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events. 2/ Methodology: 60 HLA-A0201 positive patients with CML-CP will be enrolled in this study. Only patients that have achieved CCyR with detectable BCR-ABL transcripts by RT-PCR, on a stable dose of imatinib will be enrolled. This will give us a study power of > 80% to detect a difference of 25% in molecular response between the 2 arms and will allow for a study participant drop out rate of 10% or more. All subjects will continue taking imatinib and the dose will remain unchanged throughout the course of the study. Subjects will be randomised into 2 groups. One group will receive the combination of WT1 and PR1 peptide vaccines in Montanide adjuvant administered by subcutaneous injections every 3 weeks for 6 injections (6 injections of each vaccine in total), concomitantly with GM-CSF. The second group will be observed.
Feasibility and expected results: The PR1 and WT1 peptide vaccine study is sponsored by CRUK and the peptide vaccines are being manufactured to GMP grade. The Hammersmith hospital is one of the largest CML centres in Europe with more than 300 patients being regularly followed up in the outpatient department. Therefore we do not anticipate any difficulties with patient accrual. We anticipate starting the clinical trial of PR1 and WT1 peptide vaccination in patients with CML in May 2010. We expect that vaccination with PR1 and WT1 peptide in CML patients on successful TKI therapy may increase the rate of complete molecular remission in correlation with immunological responses.
Preliminary results: The first part of this project (November 2008-October 2009) was dedicated to the study of the impact on the immune system by TKI treatments such as imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. Indeed a number of conflicting work has been published on this subject, and it seemed essential to better define the immunomodulatory effect of these treatments before beginning clinical trials of peptide vaccination. Thus 50 patients treated by one of these ITK for CML have been vaccinated against the influenza virus and pneumococcus and samples were taken before and after vaccination to determine the T lymphocyte response and B these vaccines.

Hepatocellular adenomas are rare benign liver tumors. A subgroup of adenoma (40 %), are defined as inflammatory and exhibits activation of Il6 and interferons. In 65 % of the cases, we found activating mutations of gp130, the co-receptor of IL6. However 30 % of inflammatory adenomas have no genetic alterations. In incidence hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) are the fifth cancer worldwide. In the lab, we have identified a subgroup of HCC (20 %) with overexpression of inflammatory target genes. The molecular classification, the mechanism of inflammatory pathway activation and the phenotype of these HCC are still unknown. With the development of target therapy, understanding the mechanism of inflammatory pathway activation represents a major goal in hepatic tumors.    Description of the project    Molecular analysis, phenotype and prognosis of inflammatory hepatocellular carcinomas  We will study 320 HCC. Among these HCC, 60 were defined as inflammatory because of an increase transcription of inflammatory target genes.  Using microarray, we will performed a transcriptomic analysis using microarray and analysis of 400 microRNA and  of 20 inflammatory hepatocellular carcinomas and we will validate in a second group of 40 inflammatory hepatocellular carcinomas, using quantitative RT-PCR.     We will study the genetic and epigenetic alterations of 60 inflammatory hepatocellular carcinomas by sequencing of genes classically involved in liver carcinogenesis and by studying methylation of SOCS 1 and SOCS 3, two genes responsible of inflammatory inhibition.  We will study the protein expression, using western blot, in 60 inflammatory HCC.    We will describe the histological, immunohistochemical and clinical phenotype in 60 inflammatory hepatocellular carcinomas.     We will also study the prognosis of inflammatory HCC among a well characterized group of 320 hepatocellular carcinomas.     Search for new genetic alterations involved in inflammatory pathway activation in hepatocellular tumors  The deep sequencing of 2 inflammatory hepatocellular carcinomas are on goingWe will screen for new genetic alterations in 58 inflammatory hepatocellulars carcinomas and 40 non mutated inflammatory adenomas.  We will sequence candidate genes in 60 HCC 40 non mutated inflammatory adenomas : candidate genes found in deep sequencing, gene of cyclic AMP pathway and candidate gene identified using microarray.  In hepatocellular cell lines, we will study the lines transfection of activating mutated genes, the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes using SiRNA and the effect of specific inhibitor of inflammatory pathways.  Expected results  Inflammatory HCC represent a molecular and phenotypical subgroup of HCC easily characterized in clinical practice and have a prognostic impact.

Despite major advances, 20% of children fail currently available therapies, including haemopoietic stem cell transplant. We can reliably identify patients at highest risk of relapse after transplant by assessing minimal residual disease, but at present there is no available therapy to prevent relapse in such patients. Similarly, patients who relapse after stem cell transplant are currently incurable. Novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to prevent relapse in such patients. In this study we propose to augment the immune response against leukaemia after stem cell transplant using the novel approach of chimaeric T-cell receptor transfer. This strategy overcomes the lack of immunogenic tumour antigens on leukaemic cells by redirecting T cells to surface molecules expressed by malignant cells, enabling us to target tumour cells in an HLA-independent fashion, so that a single vector can be used to treat all patients expressing this surface molecule. CD19 is an excellent target for this strategy, because it is highly expressed on the surface of almost all BCP-ALLs, but is absent on other lineages and on non-haemopoietic cells.We have generated an oncoretroviral vector coding for a chimaeric T-cell receptor consisting of a CD19-specific single chain Fv targeting domain that activates T cells via the CD3 zeta signalling domain. Previous studies have demonstrated that T cells transduced with such a vector efficiently lyse ALL cell lines and primary blasts both in vitro and in a NOD/SCID murine model. No significant toxicity attributable to transduced T cells was observed in this murine model. We now propose to administer donor T cells redirected to recognise and kill ALL blasts by retroviral transduction with a CD19 zeta chimaeric T-cell receptor in patients who develop evidence of minimal residual disease after stem cell transplant or those undergoing a second transplant procedure. Our hypothesis is that immunotherapy with CD19-specific T cells will improve the immune response against leukaemic cells and may prevent relapse after transplant. EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells will be used as effectors to reduce the potential for graft-versus-host disease and optimise the durability of responses. Our study utilizes an integrated approach to immunotherapy, including the use of transduced EBV-CTL as effectors, administration in a setting of minimal residual disease and lymphodepletion to improve in vivo expansion of the infused CTL. If the in vivo survival of CD19-specific CTL is poor in the initial patients, a further cohort will be vaccinated with irradiated EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines following CTL infusion to stimulate their proliferation to determine if this improves in vivo survival/expansion. This study will thus establish the feasibility and safety of adoptive immunotherapy with CD19-specific T cells and will provide the necessary foundations for further studies to assess the efficacy of CD19-specific T-cell transfer in reducing relapse after SCT. Such an approach may be of major benefit to patients with high-risk ALL and has important broader implications for other malignancies which may be targeted similarly using the novel approach of chimaeric T-cell receptor transfer.

One of the priorities of this thesis is therefore fundamental to the study of phenomena related to nanopulses: know the exact cause of improving the expression of DNA and their impact on the intra and extra-cellular. Other laboratory results and medical related or unrelated to those already known, can be revealed by this study.
It is also possible that synergies occur between existing treatments and this new technique. Various publications on nanopulses showed far different effects depending on whether we apply these nanopulses alone or in combination with other treatments.
It is hoped that other organizations can lead to similar results and further enhance the effects of any treatment: one can, for example, begin to associate these nanopulses to more conventional treatments for cancer like chemotherapy classic . Combination with electrochemotherapy is also a good example of the combination test.
Alongside the need to fully characterize these phenomena, it is good to focus a) the various possible applications of nanopulses, which are closely related to the previous one and can not be separated, and b) clinical systems capable to deliver pulses of this type.
Indeed, the systems currently used in research in this field systems originally intended for the study of plasmas, and therefore ill-suited to the use of interest in biology. The technologies used for the design of these systems are not, however, leave out, but rather to consider in the development of a system dedicated to biology.
The problem is posed, it follows the following objectives:
explain biological phenomena come into play for the effects of nanopulses hitherto known;

define a (of) protocol (s) which the best possible results on human cells in order to improve treatment by electrochemotherapy;
assist in the implementation and development of a clinical system to implement these nanopulses.

Recent evidence suggests that increasing levels of pollutants and toxic molecules in our environment due to continuing industrialization of our planet may play a role in the development of breast cancer, a disease whose victims are ever-increasing in number. Cancerous cells often display unusually high levels of a molecule called NF-kB/Rel, which is itself increased as an indirect result of the bodys efforts to eliminate these dangerous environmental pollutants from the system.  

 

We have investigated the development of breast cancer in rats and have found that these tumors also have high levels of NF-kB. NF-kB is also elevated in cells derived form human breast tumors. It appears, therefore, that NF-kB represents a marker for breast cancer. It is our belief that if we can counteract the dangerous effects of increased NF-kB levels, we may have a positive impact on breast cancer. 

 

One way to tackle this problem is using a molecule that specifically prevents the action of NF-kB, i.e., the IkB-a protein. This protein is present in normal cells, and it acts by forming a complex with NF-kB, so that NF-kB cannot exert any dangerous effect in the cell. We feel that if we can increase the amount of IkB-a protein in cells, then it will bind to any excess NF-kB and prevent its activation. In this way, NF-kB will not be able to have a detrimental effect on the cell, and breast cancer will not form as easily as before.  

 

The number of women with breast cancer in China and Japan is much lower than that in western countries. It is believed that this may be due, in part, to the fact that green tea is very popular in the Orient. Green tea is known to contain molecules called polyphenols that minimize the oxidation process that is a normal metabolic process of all cells and seems to contribute to increased NF-kB levels. 

 

In this grant, we have proposed experiments that will specifically examine the effect of increasing the amount of IkB-a in the cell, thereby effectively preventing the cancer-promoting effects of NF-kB. We also plan to investigate the protective effect that green tea seems to have against the development of breast cancer. We hope that these studies will provide new and important information about the development of breast disease and will give clues as to how we can better tackle the growing problem of breast cancer.",Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs,DAMD17-99-1-9083,Boston University,grid.189504.1,1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,Cancer;Prevention;Breast Cancer;Aging,66000.0,1997-10-01,1998-09-01,Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs,True,False,Boston University,True,Xiaobo WANG,"WANG, Xiaobo",1,4,False

This healing appears to be inseparable from the development of an antitumor immune response generated by cell death post-chemotherapy. The question raised by this project is to decline the molecular mechanisms subtending the antitumor vaccination post-treatment with anthracyclines (immunogenic) to make a diagnostic test predictor of response.Define immune predictors of response to adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancers.This grant application aims at validating a series of novel immune biomarkers of response to anthracyclines predicting the capacity of the host to get immunized (and cured) against his tumor with the hindsight to compensate the defects in immune signaling by specific targeted therapies in « predicted » non-responders.  The program project will be performed by the coordinated action of two INSERM teams worldwide recognized in the field of cell death biology and immunotherapy of cancer (U1015 and U848 INSERM closed to the Center of Clinical Investigations CICBT507), one bioinformatician/biomathematician from Ecole des Mines, and the IGR&D tech transfer Department of IGR. The immune biomarkers of response to anthracyclines are composed of 3 nucleic acid probes (CRT map of the ER stress response, derived from tumor RNA) and of 3-6 nucleic acid probes (SNPs in host genes, derived from tumor or leukocyte DNA), for the latter depending whether the setting is adjuvant or neoadjuvant. Objective number 1 will be the validation of these immune signatures in two retrospective cohorts of 680 neoadjuvant treated BC and a 400 adjuvant treated BC. Objective number 2 will be to set up a reliable GLP chip array of prevalidated nucleic acid probes for routine usage. This tool will be patented, the rationale to start up a Biotec.

Set up an abaque or internal standard of all >300 specimen (obtained from all our retrospective studies containing >300 patients) which have determined the mean+/-sem of expression of each parameter to assess the “relative abundance “and positive and negative controls for the cDNA exploring the CRT map. Task 6. Benchmarking and search for potential partners to outsource the manufacturing of the final device (diagnosis kit).",French National Research Agency,ANR-11-EMMA-0020,Institut Gustave Roussy,grid.14925.3b,1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,Cancer;Genetics;Biotechnology;Breast Cancer;Clinical Research,352938.0,2012-01-01,2013-06-30,French National Research Agency,True,False,Institut Gustave Roussy,True,Laurence ZITVOGEL,"ZITVOGEL, Laurence",1,5,False
inca_1286,Laurence,ZITVOGEL,Institut Gustave Roussy,grant.7153816,Role of the inflammasome in the transition between tolerance and inflammation during chemo-or-radiotherapy of cancer,"Background and significance: Anti-tumor immunity involves a balance between effector and regulatory lymphocytes, acting in parallel to either destroy or promote tumor development. While CD8+ T cells are largely described as antitumor effectors acting through cytotoxicity and IFNgamma production, CD4+ T cells encompass different subsets that express lineage-specific transcription factors and play different roles in initiating and supporting the development of immune responses and regulating them. FOXP3+ CD4+Treg are suppressive ex-vivo and fail to secrete IL-2 or IFN-gamma. They play a major role in the control of self-tolerance, their depletion or functional alteration resulting in the development of autoimmune diseases and tumor rejection. The recently described RORgammat+ CD4+ TH17 cells produce IL-17A and IL-17F cytokines bearing pro-inflammatory functions and mediate protection against extracellular bacteria and fungi but also pathogenesis in certain autoimmune diseases and potentially during cancer progression. Initial studies assessing the differentiation of Treg and TH17 cells from naïve CD4+ T cells have reported reciprocally regulated and mutually exclusive differentiation programs for the two subsets. However, several reports have documented conversion of murine and human Treg into TH17 cells following stimulation under various conditions. Our recent data and driving hypothesis: In support of the relevance of Treg/TH17 conversion in human cancer, we have recently shown that tumor-associated-Treg from ovarian cancer patients are converted into RORgammat+TH17 cells in the presence of IL-2, autologous APC and tumor cells or rhuIL-1beta (Leveque L. et al., J. Immunother. 2009). The fine equilibrium between Treg and TH17 i.e between tolerance and inflammation may be crucial during natural tumor progression and/or more specifically during anticancer therapy. We identified two clinical physiopathological conditions where the conversion of Treg into TH17 cells could occur and be relevant in the resolution of the disease. First, we showed that during chemo- or radio-therapy, dying tumor cells released ATP which, following binding to P2X7 receptors on DC, promoted an inflammatory cascade involving the NALP3 inflammasome (NALP3/ ASC/Caspase-1) culminating in IL-1beta secretion and IL-1beta-dependent Tc1 differentiation (Ghiringhelli et al. Nat. Med. In revision, Apetoh et al. Keystone Jan 2009). NALP3 or P2X7 or casp-1 or IL-1R1 knock out mice failed to respond to oxaliplatin or X rays in contrast to WT littermates. Therefore, we hypothetize that the chemotherapy-induced inflammasome might promote the conversion of Treg into TH17 cells. Specific aims of the study: proof of principle that the “immunogenic chemotherapy” promotes the conversion of Treg into TH17 i.e tolerance into inflammation that is required for its antitumor efficacy. 1/ Identify human dendritic cell (DC) subsets reacting with dying tumor cells to ignite the inflammasome and promote IL-1beta Secretion; 2/ Study the potential conversion of human memory Tregs (MTreg) into TH17 in the presence of DC pulsed with dying tumor cells; 3/ Cell death pathways involved in the induction of the DC inflammasome (such as proteasome or tyrosine kinase or NF-kB inhibitors, taxanes, anthracyclines, FasL or TRAIL-mediated cell death inducers); 4/ In vivo significance : role of IL-17, IL-17R, CD4 or Treg in the efficacy of chemo- or radio-therapy in tumor bearing hosts. A kinetic study of Treg and TH17 numbers and functions in tumor beds and tumor draining lymph nodes will be performed during the chemotherapy hit in tumor bearing mice. 
Expected results: We aim at determining the role of the inflammasome in dictating the role of Treg and/or TH17, the clinical relevance of Treg and/or TH17 in the efficacy or lack of efficacy of chemotherapy, or the potential conversion of Treg into TH17 or a source of biologically relevant IL-17 (potentially being gamme-deltaT cells or iNKT) in regressing tumor beds or their draining lymph nodes. These data will help us to sort out the role of these actors in the immunogenicity of cell death.
