# Approach to Researcher Info

## Email Linking
- Linking between an INCA database of researcher emails and the Dimensions data was done using fuzzy matching on researcher names.

## Complementing with Gerard Chevalier info
- For some of researchers where we were unable to match an email from the INCA database, Gerard Chevalier manually added email addresses.

## ORCID returns
- Researchers who linked their ORCID account were manually marked in the `researcher_info_ORCID_returns.csv` file by Nicolas.

### ORCID returns that were impossible to match to original data:
- Delphine NOLLET
- julie pannequin
- VAN SEUNINGEN
- Sandrine Caputo
- Emmanuel FARGE
- Annick Harel-Bellan
- Yegor Vassetzky
