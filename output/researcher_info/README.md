# Approach to Researcher Info

## Email Linking
- Linking between an INCA database of researcher emails and the Dimensions data was done using fuzzy matching on researcher names.

## Complementing with Gerard Chevalier info
- For some of researchers where we were unable to match an email from the INCA database, Gerard Chevalier manually added email addresses.

## ORCID returns
- Researchers who linked their ORCID account were manually marked in the `researcher_info_ORCID_returns.csv` file by Nicolas (the last number to be linked was 213).

### ORCID returns that were impossible to match to original data:
- Yegor Vassetzky
- Annick Harel-Bellan
- Emmanuel FARGE
- Sandrine Caputo
- VAN SEUNINGEN
- julie pannequin
- Delphine NOLLET
